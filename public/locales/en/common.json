  "intro": "Formerly I was working in the Electronics field. More precisely I was working more often with microcontrollers and assembly language and later on C++ developing platforms related to them and finally with FPGAs (Field Programable Gate Arrays). However, I was lucky to take the chance and get involved in web development and very soon I found myself immersed in coding the web. No doubt that is interesting and I am open to any opportunity to dive even deeper to it."
